title: All in on AI

This entire website was built with AI, primarily using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) with Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the language model. I created the site without writing a single line of code myself, instead having a conversation with the AI about what I wanted.

## Tools Used

The site is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a simple yet powerful static site generator. I chose 11ty for its simplicity and flexibility, and the AI helped implement:

- Markdown content processing
- Customized CSS with variables
- Code syntax highlighting with PrismJS
- Font integration with variable fonts
- Date-based post organization

All the styling, configuration, templates, and example content were generated through AI prompting. The dark theme, monospace aesthetic, and minimalist design were all implemented by describing my preferences to the AI.

## Looking Forward

AI-assisted coding is changing how I approach software development across the board. Beyond this website, I'm using AI to help with more complex projects:

- A native macOS audio player app (coming soon!)
- Refactoring and optimizing legacy codebases
- Rapid prototyping of new ideas
- Learning unfamiliar programming languages and frameworks
- Automating repetitive development tasks

There's more to come as I continue to explore what's possible with modern AI tools. Stay tuned!
