## Who I Am

I'm a software developer, engineering leader, and technology enthusiast. Currently, I serve as Head of Development at Mediaflow, where I balance hands-on coding with broader engineering strategy and team leadership responsibilities.

My career has spanned various technologies and roles, from full-stack development to web design/UI/UX and technical leadership. Throughout this journey, I've focused on delivering effective results, prioritizing practical solutions that work well over theoretical elegance. That said, I do appreciate dry, efficient code that gets the job done without unnecessary complexity.

## What I Do

My day-to-day work involves:

- Leading development teams and setting technical direction
- Mentoring and growing other developers
- Balancing technical debt with innovation
- Staying hands-on with code to maintain technical sharpness

Outside of work, I explore new technologies through side projects, most recently diving into AI-assisted development, which has dramatically changed how I approach coding challenges.

## This Site

This minimalist website showcases my experiments, thoughts, and projects. Built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), it's designed to focus on content rather than flashy features. Some technical features include:

- Dark theme with monospace fonts for readability
- Code syntax highlighting for technical posts
- Markdown content for easy writing
- Clean, distraction-free design

Interestingly, this entire site was built through AI assistance using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) and Claude-3.7-Sonnet. I described what I wanted, and the AI helped implement it - an experiment that proved incredibly effective and time-efficient.
