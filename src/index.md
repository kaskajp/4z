title: Jonas Raneryd Imaizumi - That's me
---

By day, I wrangle code and engineering teams as Head of Development at Mediaflow. By night, I've fallen down a fascinating rabbit hole of AI-assisted programming that's completely transformed how I build software. This site is living proofâ€”I "wrote" it by having conversations with an AI, not by typing a single line of code myself. Join me as I document this strange new world where the line between human and machine creativity blurs, and where a well-crafted prompt can accomplish in minutes what used to take days.
