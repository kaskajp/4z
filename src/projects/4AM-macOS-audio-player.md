## Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI for the interface
- AVFoundation for audio processing

## AI Assistance

This application is developed with AI assistance. The core foundation of the application was built with moderate assistance using ChatGPT's *Work with Apps* feature and Xcode.

Once the core foundation was built, I switched to Cursor to build additional features, such as favorites, global search, settings, and more. To experiment with Cursor's agent mode, all of the extra features have been almost completely vibe coded. Ask, accept, repeat.
