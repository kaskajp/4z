# This Website

This minimalist website was built as an experiment in AI-assisted development. Using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the static site generator, the entire site was created through conversations with an AI assistant rather than by writing code directly.

## Features

- Dark theme with monospace typography
- Markdown content for easy writing
- Code syntax highlighting with PrismJS
- Blog posts with chronological organization
- Projects section for showcasing work
- Clean, minimalist design philosophy

## How It Was Built

I built this site by having a conversation with [Claude](https://anthropic.com/claude) through the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) code editor. Instead of writing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript directly, I described what I wanted in natural language and the AI generated the code. This allowed for rapid iteration and a focus on the conceptual aspects rather than implementation details.

## Tech Stack

- 11ty for static site generation
- Custom CSS with variables for theming
- PrismJS for code syntax highlighting
- Markdown for content
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Claude AI for assistance

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrated how AI can dramatically speed up web development for basic sites. That said, this site is so basic that it wouldn't have taken me very long to build it without AI assistance. The process was particularly strong for:

- Scaffolding the initial project setup
- Creating consistent styling across the site
- Implementing code syntax highlighting
- Setting up the content organization
- Writing initial content
