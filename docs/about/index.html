    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>I'm a software developer, engineering leader, and technology enthusiast. Currently, I serve as Head of Development at Mediaflow, where I balance hands-on coding with broader engineering strategy and team leadership responsibilities.</p>
<p>My career has spanned various technologies and roles, from full-stack development to web design/UI/UX and technical leadership. Throughout this journey, I've focused on delivering effective results, prioritizing practical solutions that work well over theoretical elegance. That said, I do appreciate dry, efficient code that gets the job done without unnecessary complexity.</p>
<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>My day-to-day work involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading development teams and setting technical direction</li>
<li>Mentoring and growing other developers</li>
<li>Balancing technical debt with innovation</li>
<li>Staying hands-on with code to maintain technical sharpness</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of work, I explore new technologies through side projects, most recently diving into AI-assisted development, which has dramatically changed how I approach coding challenges.</p>
<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>This minimalist website showcases my experiments, thoughts, and projects. Built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, it's designed to focus on content rather than flashy features. Some technical features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dark theme with monospace fonts for readability</li>
<li>Code syntax highlighting for technical posts</li>
<li>Markdown content for easy writing</li>
<li>Clean, distraction-free design</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, this entire site was built through AI assistance using <a href="https://cursor.sh/">Cursor</a> and Claude-3.7-Sonnet. I described what I wanted, and the AI helped implement it - an experiment that proved incredibly effective and time-efficient.</p>
