    <h1>Compiling this website with Python</h1>
    <p>This website is compiled using a fairly simple Python script. Why? You might ask. And well, to be fair, I
    just felt like writing some Python. But I also wanted to just keep it simple while staying away from all the
    mumbo-jumbo JavaScript world for a change, since I do that every day anyway.</p>
    <p>My website structure looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
        src
            includes
                header.html
                footer.html
            views
                posts
                    some-post.html
                other-loosey-goosey-view.html
            index.html</pre>
    <p>And here's the build script:</p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/kaskajp/4cbca37f98e3842acf044f67772aacae.js"></script>
</main>
        </main>
    </body>
</html>
