<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Native macOS experience with SwiftUI</li>
<li>Fast folder scanning</li>
<li>Albums view</li>
<li>Favorites</li>
<li>Support for all common audio formats</li>
<li>Smart playlists and library management</li>
<li>Low resource usage</li>
<li>Disk caching for artwork</li>
</ul>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>This project is currently in active development but in a working state. It will be available as a public beta soon.</p>
<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<ul>
<li>Swift</li>
<li>SwiftUI for the interface</li>
<li>AVFoundation for audio processing</li>
<li>SwiftData for library management</li>
<li>TagLib for metadata parsing</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI Assistance</h2>
<p>This application is developed with AI assistance. The core foundation of the application was built with moderate assistance using ChatGPT's <em>Work with Apps</em> feature and Xcode.</p>
<p>Once the core foundation was built, I switched to Cursor to build additional features, such as favorites, global search, settings, and more. To experiment with Cursor's agent mode, all of the extra features have been almost completely vibe coded. Ask, accept, repeat.</p>
